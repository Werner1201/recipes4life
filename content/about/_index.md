## Recipes4Life
<p>It is an iniciative to remove the bloat of recipe websites, especially ads and trackers that always takes a lot of time from actually reading the recipe on the website.</p>
<p>This website is a prototype of the ideal recipe encyclopedia, where everything added is not controlled by the owner of the website but by the community, via pull requests, where it is discussed if it is not a dupe or it is not recipe at all. </p>
